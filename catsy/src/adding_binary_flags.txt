StructOpt makes it really easy to add binary flags, also known as toggles
or switches. Cowsay has a flag called --dead (-d), which will change
the cow's eye from an "o" symbol to an "x" ,  a classic, comical expression 
of death. You can easily implement this by adding the code to the options
sturct , as shown in the Listing 


adding a binary flag called -- dead


#[derive(StructOpt) ]

struct Options
{
    message : String

    #[structopt( short = "d", long = "dead") ]
    /// make the cat appear dead 
    dead : bool,
}



You add a field of type bool named dead. You can assign the long and
short version of the flag by annotating the field with #[structopt(short = 
"d", long ="dead")] . The help message will now look like this:


FLAGS:

-d , --dead Makes the cat appear dead
-h  --help  Prints help informaton 
-V --version Prints version informaton 

To use the flag, you can modify the main() function, as shown in Listing
