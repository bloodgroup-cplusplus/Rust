 1  Fundamentals and Syntax of the Rust Programming Language                       
  2  Rust is an extrememly fast powerful systems language                           
  3  Example of systems language c,c++, golang                                      
  4  unlike java, c# and javascript                                                 
  5  Application programming is user facing software                                
  6  Drivers Compilers are built with systems language                              
  7  Rust is being relevant in web development                                      
  8  Web Aseembly or wasam is efficient byte level for web                          
  9  If we want to get to webassembly rust is very important                        
 10  Rust is used to make webdev faster                                             
 11  If you are a webdev and wanting to run web and wasam then rust is essential    
 12  Advantages to rust :                                                           
 13     No garbage collection and we don't have to manage memory                    
 14     C and C++ we handle garbage collection all by ourself                       
 15     Rust works in different way than both of these                              
 16     It checks memory on demand when needed                                      
 17     Rust has package manager called cargo like pip or npm to manage packages and track dependencies
 18
